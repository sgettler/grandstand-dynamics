Performs analysis of grandstand structures according to the IStructE guideline,
*Dynamic Performance Requirements For Permanent Grandstands Subject To Crowd
Action* (2008).

This software was developed for analysis of grandstands using SPS Terraces, but
is equally applicable to any structural system. The input to this application is
the solved mode shapes for the structure; tools and techniques for modeling of
the structural system are up to the user.
